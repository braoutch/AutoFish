Here are AutoFishâ€™s specifications :

- The temperature is measured and displayed.
- The heater turns on only when it needs to, depending on the temperature (next : and the time).
- Light and oxygens are turned on depending on the time (next : and the month).
- A switch forces lights to be on (ignoring the previous point).
- A buzzer and a let display some alerts when needed.
- A pushbutton deactivate the pump for 5 minutes (for feeding).
- A quality percentage is calculated.
- A 20x4 led display handles the rest.
